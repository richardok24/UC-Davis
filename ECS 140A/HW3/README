part1:
Class Element, MyInteger, MyChar, Sequence, and there methods are defined.

part2: Passed Test2.java
Print method is added to each class. Method first, rest, length, add, and delete methods are added to the Sequence class.

part3: Passed Test3.java
Method index, flatten, and copy are added to the Sequence class.

part4: Passed Test4.java
Class SequenceIterator is created to serve as an iterator over Sequence objects.

part5: Passed Test5.java
Class Matrix, which represents a 2D array of integers, is defined by entending Sequence. Set, Get, Sum, Product, and Print methods are added to the Matrix class.

part6: Passed Test6.java
Class Map, MapIterator, and Pair are created. A Map object stores a set of Pair objects. Each Pair object contains a key object and a value object. A key object refers to a MyChar object whereas a value object can refer to any type of Element. The elements can be stored and retrieved using a key.MapIterator object is similar to that of a SequenceIterator object.
